// C++ is used to create computer programs, and is one of the most used language in game development.
// C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.


#include <iostream>
// header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
// <iostream> header file (pre-written code)
using namespace std; // we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
int main() // it is a function(it is a block of code means doing some work)
// it is a starting point of any c++ program

{
  //(pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello jayesh!".
  cout << "hello jayesh!";
  // cout ==> charcter output
  // << ==> intersection operator
  return 0;
  // main function are end here
}
//  The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
